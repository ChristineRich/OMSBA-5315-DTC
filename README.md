Collaboration with Christine Rich, Tamlyn Tamura, Ian Ceazar Basco, Glen Lewis, Andrew Nalundasan

**Purpose:** 
The purpose of this project is to build an on-line movie recommender using Spark and present the system to the board of an imaginary company, Ripe Pumpkins.

**Research Question:**
The board would like to explore if the recommendation engine yield insights of individual customer's preferences that eventually affect customer's likelihood stay with our services than competitors' services.

**Data:** 
Data collected by GroupLens found here: https://movielens.org/

**Conclusion:** 
If Ripe Pumpkins determines that it wants to stick with content-based filtering over collaborative filtering for now, then more data needs to be analyzed to explain why users, like Andrew and Christine, preferred certain recommended content over others. The reality is that people's taste in movies are influenced from a wide range of reasons, not just genre. Some people may like movies for the cast, soundtrack, or time period a movie was made. Perhaps some people only like one or two movies in a specific genre but dislike the rest, simply because they enjoyed the plot, animation style, or dialogue. 

The Pumpkinmeter model is on the right path but needs time to further enhance its recommendation algorithm for Ripe Pumpkins to successfully compete amongst the major players in todayâ€™s market such as Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO. A partnership between the data science and marketing teams will help Ripe Pumpkins to refine the Pumpkinmeter model to maximize engagement with customers, enabling them to compete in this space.
